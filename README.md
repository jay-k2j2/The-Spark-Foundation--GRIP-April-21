## The Spark Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in India and Singapore and operating globally.


I am part of their graduate rotational internship program(GRIP) for the April batch. I have performed the above tasks during my internship period.

In some of the projects I used plotly express for visualization purpose

In some of the projects I used Plotly express for visualization purposes, these plots are not visible here in GitHub, I will recommend it to download the notebook and try to run it in COLAB or in your local system.
